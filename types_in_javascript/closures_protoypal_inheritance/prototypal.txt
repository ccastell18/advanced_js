Prototypal Inheritance:

Inheritance is an object getting access to properties and methods from other objects.  

ex.

const array = []
array.__proto__ (shows array properties)            object
array.__proto__.__proto__(shows base object)       /       \
                                              array       function
ex.
 function a(){}
 a.__proto__(function code)
 a.__proto__.__proto__(shows base object) 

 An example of Inheritance

 let dragon = {
   name: 'Tanya',
   fire: true,
   fight(){
     return 5
   },
   sing(){
     return `I am ${this.name}, the breather of fire.`
   }
 }

 let lizard = {
   name: 'Kiki',
   fight(){
     return 1 
   }
 }
 To access the methods from another object.
 const singLizard = dragon.sing.bind(lizard) adds the sing method from dragon to lizard. 

to aquire all methods and properties from dragon 
 lizard.__proto__ = dragon;
 anything that is declared in lizard will override dragon.

 lizard.__proto__ = dragon;
 for(let prop in lizard){
   console.log(properties)
 }
 will list all properties .

 lizard.__proto__ = dragon;
 for(let prop in lizard){
   if(lizard.hasOwnProperty(prop)){
     console.log(prop);
   }
 }
 will only list the props the lizard has declared, not inherited.
