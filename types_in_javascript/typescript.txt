static languages - variables must be declared before given a value.

pros: 
-documentation
cons: 
-harder to read.

ex. int a;
    a = 100

  function sum(a: number, b: number){
    return a + b
  }


dynamic languages - can determine types on their own.  
ex. var a = 100;

weak languages- you can add two different types.
strong languages - throws errors if types don't match.

Typescript has it's own compiler.  Adds functionality on top of Javascript.
