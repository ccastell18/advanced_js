Added to ES6

Let and Const
using var can change variables within brackets. 
let - the new var. cannot change variables
const - can never be reassigned. If an object is a const, you can change properties within. 

Destructuring
 const obj = {
    player: 'bobby',
    experience: 100, 
    wizardlLevel: false
 }

 const player = obj.player
 const experience = obj.experience
 const wizardlLevel = obj.wizardlLevel

 //destructured
 const {player, experience} = obj;
//access to properties with less code.

Object properties
if property and value are the same, just need the property name

const a = "simon"
const b = 'true'
const c = {};
const obj = {a, b, c} 

instead of 
const obj ={
  a:a,
  b:b,
  c:c
}
